# gRPC Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) Overview

## Introduction

gRPC is a high-performance, language-agnostic framework for building remote procedure call (RPC) services. It uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as authentication, load balancing, and more. In gRPC, there are four primary types of RPC calls:

1. **Unary RPC**
2. **Server Streaming RPC**
3. **Client Streaming RPC**
4. **Bidirectional Streaming RPC**

For more detailed information about gRPC, please visit the [official gRPC website](https://grpc.io/).

In this README, we will briefly describe each of these types of RPC calls.

## 1. Unary RPC

Unary RPC is the simplest form of RPC in which the client sends a single request to the server and receives a single response.

## 2. Server Streaming RPC

Server Streaming RPC allows the client to send a single request to the server and receive a stream of responses.

## 3. Client Streaming RPC

Client Streaming RPC is the reverse of Server Streaming RPC. The client sends a stream of requests to the server and receives a single response.

## 4. Bidirectional Streaming RPC

Bidirectional Streaming RPC enables both the client and server to send a stream of messages to each other, allowing for real-time communication.

## Conclusion

gRPC offers these different types of RPC calls to accommodate various use cases, from simple request-response interactions to more complex bidirectional streaming. Understanding these types of RPC calls is fundamental for designing efficient and scalable gRPC services.
